Hello, I'm John I'm a developer and designer currently exploring the realms of game development and 3D modeling. With a love for creative problem-solving, I'm deeply engaged in building immersive environments and interactive experiences.

**Game Development:** I've been working with Unreal Engine, focusing on aspects like enemy and player interactions, and I have experience in creating dynamic gameplay mechanics using Blueprints. My projects range from designing detailed 3D restaurant models to crafting engaging zombie games in Roblox Studio.

**3D Modeling:** A beginner in Blender, I enjoy bringing ideas to life with 3D models, from simple household items to complex scenes.

**Tech Stack:** Proficient in Unreal Engine, Roblox Studio, and Pygame. I'm also familiar with basic coding in environments like Code.org and have a history of solving complex problems in C++ and Python.

**Current Work:** Iâ€™m currently focused on developing a zombie game in Roblox Studio, where I'm learning to handle collisions and variable updates effectively. Additionally, I'm enhancing my Unreal Engine project by integrating sophisticated enemy logic and player interactions.

**Learning:** Always eager to learn more and improve my skills, I am open to collaborating on projects and sharing knowledge with fellow developers.

**How to reach me:** Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub or via instagram.
